        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Completed in 1931 by Le Corbusier and Pierre Jeanneret in Poissy, 
          The Villa Savoye is one of the most significant contributions to modern 
          architecture in the 20th century and an outstanding example of the 
          International style. The revolutionary building is also an early 
          example of the architect’s “five points” for new constructions.</p>
        <h3>The Five Points</h3>
        <p>Early in his career, Le Corbusier developed a set of architectural principles 
          that dictated his technique, which he called the "Five Points of Modern Architecture" 
          (French: Cinq points de l'architecture moderne). They are considered 
          to be most evident in his Villa Savoye. The five points are:</p>
        <p>&#9899; Pilotis – replacement of supporting walls by a grid of reinforced concrete 
          columns that bears the structural load is the basis of the new aesthetic</p>
        <p>&#9899; The free designing of the ground plan – the absence of supporting walls – 
          means the house is unrestrained in its internal use</p>
        <p>&#9899; The free design of the façade – separating the exterior of the building 
          from its structural function – sets the façade free from structural constraints</p>
        <p>&#9899; The horizontal window, which cuts the façade along its entire length, lights rooms equally</p>
        <p>&#9899; Roof gardens on a flat roof can serve a domestic purpose while 
          providing essential protection to the concrete roof.</p>

        <p>Dom-Ino House (French: Maison Dom-Ino) is an open floor plan modular structure 
          designed by the pioneering architect Le Corbusier in 1914–1915. This design became 
          the foundation for most of his architecture for the next ten years.</p>
        <p>This model proposed an open floor plan consisting of concrete slabs supported 
          by a minimal number of thin, reinforced concrete columns around the edges, 
          with a stairway providing access to each level on one side of the floor plan. 
          The frame was to be completely independent of the floor plans of the houses thus 
          giving freedom to design the interior configuration. The model eliminated load-bearing 
          walls and the supporting beams for the ceiling.This model proposed an open floor plan
